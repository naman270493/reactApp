Map, Filter and Reduce in Javascript

With functional programming you'll never have to write a for loop again.
When you call map on an array, it executes that callback on every element within it, returning a new array with all of the values that the callback returned.

map passes three arguments to your callback
The current item in the array
The array index of the current item
The entire array you called map on 

var tasks = [
 
  {
 
    'name'     : 'Write for Envato Tuts+',
 
    'duration' : 120
 
  },
 
  {
 
    'name'     : 'Work out',
 
    'duration' : 60
 
  },
 
  {
 
    'name'     : 'Procrastinate on Duolingo',
 
    'duration' : 240
 
  }
 
];
Using for loop
var task_names = [];
 
for (var i = 0, max = tasks.length; i < max; i += 1) {
 
    task_names.push(tasks[i].name);
 
}


Using forEach

var task_names = [];
 
tasks.forEach(function (task) {
 
    task_names.push(task.name);
     
});
Using map
var task_names = tasks.map(function (task, index, array) {
 
    return task.name; 
 
});
Don't have to create a new array and push into it. map returns the finished product all in one go
forEach returns undefined, so it doesn't chain with other array methods. map returns an array, so you can chain it with other array methods.
Arrow functions let us leave out the return keyword in one-liners. 
var task_names = tasks.map((task) => task.name );

Filter - It takes an array, and filters out unwanted elements.
var difficult_tasks = [];
 
tasks.forEach(function (task) {
    if (task.duration >= 120) {
        difficult_tasks.push(task);
    }
});
With ES6

var difficult_tasks = tasks.filter((task) => task.duration >= 120 );

Reduce - takes all of the elements in an array, and reduces them into a single value.
reduce passes your callback four arguments
current value, prev value, current index, array you called reduce on
var total_time = tasks.reduce(function (previous, current) {
    return previous + current;
}, 0);
Using arrow
var total_time = tasks.reduce((previous, current)=> previous + current );
For Concatenation 
var array_of_arrays = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]];
var concatenated = array_of_arrays.reduce( function (previous, current) {
        return previous.concat(current);	});
.find() method - get the value of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided condition
The some() method checks if any of the elements in an array pass a test (provided as a function)
